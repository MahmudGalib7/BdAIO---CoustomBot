I have created a discord server, which is the official server of a AI Olympiad,
Means i made the official discord server of a country,
It started with the camp members from the olympiad, where students are choosen for
international representation, so i want to add bot, to make it more better,
My friend has created the management bot! Now i want to create a bot, that
fills up his lackings

My plan is to create a bot for my discord server!

It will have this jobs:

Will detect bad words but wont notify the user,
instead it will just send a warning in the given chat i have,
as because of context even bad words means another thing,
i as a owner will take the responsibility

I want it to detect spam and stop it,
since its a public group, a lot of people will come
here, so spamming should be forbidden,
also it will detect @everyone

I want it to track user activity,
it will show graph stuff regarding the user activity

We are going to create weekly contests, so when i
create poll ( if possible the bot will create poll ) and
those who reacts on it, will have a automatic message by
the bot asking for their kaggleId, And i want them
up line to line in a single place who is participating
and beside them, their kaggle profile

This are the needs as of now!
My plan is to use,
Discord.py for Building the Model
Before creating model, lets first create a outline,
Its an AI Olympiad community, if there is anything else
i should keep my eyes on! Also I'm 15, and i dont have money
to pay for backends stuff, i want to use free-host
that will be online 24/7
